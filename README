# Bookmark Sorter

This repository contains a utility script `bookmark_sorter.py` that can parse an exported bookmarks HTML file and sort the links into a simple category tree.

## Features

- Reads a standard browser bookmark HTML export.
- Downloads each page and attempts to classify it by:
  1. **Content type** (video, article, tool, service)
  2. **Domain** (crypto, self-improvement, education)
  3. **Theme** (Python, women's psychology, cryptocurrency projects)
- Creates a directory tree `sorted_bookmarks/<content type>/<domain>/<theme>.txt` with the URLs placed accordingly.
- Any unreachable URLs are written to `sorted_bookmarks/unreachable.txt`.

The categorisation is basic and uses keyword heuristics from the domain and page contents. You can adjust the keyword lists in the script as needed.

## Usage

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # install dependencies
python3 bookmark_sorter.py path/to/bookmarks.html --out output_folder
```

Use `--limit N` to process only the first `N` bookmarks when testing.

## Requirements

The script depends on:

- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`

You can install them manually or by using a requirements file.
