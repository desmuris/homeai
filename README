# Bookmark Sorter

This repository contains a utility script `bookmark_sorter.py` that can parse an exported bookmarks HTML file and sort the links into a simple category tree.

## Features

- Reads a standard browser bookmark HTML export.
- Downloads each page and attempts to classify it by:
  1. **Content type** (video, article, tool, service)
  2. **Domain** (crypto, self-improvement, education)
  3. **Theme** (Python, women's psychology, cryptocurrency projects)
- Creates a directory tree `sorted_bookmarks/<content type>/<domain>/<theme>.txt` with the URLs placed accordingly.
- Any unreachable URLs are written to `sorted_bookmarks/unreachable.txt`.

The categorisation uses the OpenAI API to analyse each page. The model is asked
to provide a content type, domain category and theme based on the page text and
URL. Any links that cannot be fetched are placed in `sorted_bookmarks/unreachable.txt`.

Set the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your API key before running
the script.

## Usage

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # install dependencies
python3 bookmark_sorter.py path/to/bookmarks.html --out output_folder
```

Use `--limit N` to process only the first `N` bookmarks when testing.

## Requirements

The script depends on:

- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `openai`

You can install them manually or by using a requirements file.
